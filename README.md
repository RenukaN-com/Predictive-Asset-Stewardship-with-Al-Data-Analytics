# Predictive Asset Stewardship with AI & Data Analytics  

*Duration:* Aug 2024 - May 2025  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
- Developed an *AI-powered Road Wear Prediction Dashboard* using a *hybrid machine learning model*:  
  - *LSTM* for time-series traffic/environmental data.  
  - *GBM* for precise *Road Wear Index prediction*.  
- Integrated *real-time traffic data* (vehicle speed, count) and *environmental data* (temperature, humidity) via *sensors/simulations* and *weather APIs*.  
- Built a *Flask-based backend* for data processing and *JSON outputs*.  
- Designed a *frontend using HTML, JavaScript, and Chart.js* for *live visualizations and alerts*.  
- Implemented *real-time updates (every 60 seconds)* with *color-coded alerts*:  
  - âœ… Safe  
  - âš  Warning  
  - ðŸ”´ Critical  
- Evaluated system with performance metrics: *MAE, RMSE, RÂ²*.
